# Good Bread (Depreciated)
### A social media React app for cooking and baking Recipes

An old version of GoodBread that focused more on user interaction. Development switched to a newer version that can be found [here](https://github.com/Rmiverson/goodbread)

In this app you can write recipes and post them. You can follow other people and see their recipies. Following people will put their recipes on to your homepage feed. You can like recipes, comment on recipies, and like other peoples comments on recipes. You can also search any recipe by title in the search tab. In the profile tab you can see your own profile as well as all the recipes you've written.
